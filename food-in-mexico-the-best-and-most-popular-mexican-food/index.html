The small, mountainous country has a long history of culinary influences from both Europe and Asia, but its native ingredients—mainly corn and chilies—are what give the cuisine its unique flavors. Whether you're craving tacos or pozole (a spicy broth), here's a list of the most popular dishes that make up Mexican cuisine that you have to taste when planning to visit Mexico:</p><h2>Tacos</h2><p>In Mexico, you can't walk more than a block without passing a taqueria. These small restaurants are usually no bigger than a living room, and they specialize in tacos—small tortillas filled with meat, vegetables or cheese.</p><p>One of the most popular authentic Mexican foods, but the word "taco" actually comes from the Nahuatl (Aztec) word tlacuache which means "half-cooked." The original tacos were made by wrapping corn tortillas around meat and then cooking them over an open flame on top of hot stones. Today's famous Mexican tacos are typically served in flour tortillas but still retain their origins as handheld snacks that you eat on the go with salsa and/or mayonnaise for dipping.</p><h2>Tortilla Chips and Salsa</h2><p>Tortilla chips are made from corn, and they're the perfect vehicle for salsa. Salsa is a popular dip for tortilla chips, but it also makes an amazing topping on tacos and burritos. Widely regarded as delicious Mexican comfort food and also a must try when you travel to Mexico.</p><h2>Quesadillas</h2><p>Quesadillas are a Mexican dish made from corn tortillas that are filled with cheese and other ingredients, then grilled or fried. Quesadillas are a popular street food in Mexico, but you can also make them at home and eat them for breakfast, lunch or dinner.</p><p>Quesadillas originated in the states of Hidalgo and Tlaxcala in central Mexico around the 16th century. They are a basic dish in Mexican cuisine today and are common all over the country. The traditional quesadilla has only two ingredients: cheese and tortilla (or maize tortilla). However, modern variations include many fillings such as meats (such as chorizo), vegetables (e.g., spinach) or seafoods (e.g., shrimp).</p><h2>Burritos</h2><p>A burrito is a type of Mexican food. It consists of a flour tortilla wrapped around a filling. The word "burrito" means "little donkey."</p><p>The most common fillings for burritos are beans, rice and meat such as chicken or beef. Other types of filling include vegetables (onions, peppers), cheese, guacamole and salsas. Burritos can be eaten on their own or with nachos or tacos on the side.</p><p>Sometimes people have trouble pronouncing the name "burrito," but it's actually quite easy: just say it like you're saying "burly toto."</p><h2>Tamales</h2><p>Tamales are a traditional Mexican food made of steamed corn dough. They can be sweet or savory, but they're usually wrapped in corn husks or banana leaves and then boiled or steamed.</p><p>Tamales are typically eaten at Christmas, when families gather to enjoy them. Tamales also play a role in many other holidays and special occasions throughout Mexico, such as Independence Day (September 16th), Day of the Dead (November 2nd) and Candlemas (February 2nd).</p><h2>Enchiladas</h2><p>Enchiladas are a type of rolled corn tortilla stuffed with a choice filling, covered with a chili pepper sauce, and often garnished with cheese, sour cream, or salsa. Enchiladas can be filled with meat (usually shredded chicken or beef), vegetables and cheese. They can also be made with seafood such as shrimp or fish. Enchiladas are usually eaten as an appetizer or main course, sometimes accompanied by rice and beans.</p><p>Enchiladas were first created in Mexico City during the 19th century by the chef Ignacio Cadena at the request of Gabino Barreda y Cortes, who was the director of public works for Mexico City at that time. Cadena's original recipe called for strips of meat to be placed in corn tortillas before being dipped into red chile sauce then topped with grated cheese and baked until golden brown; this dish soon became very popular throughout Mexico City among both locals and visitors from other states who enjoyed visiting its restaurants especially when entertaining foreign dignitaries from Europe</p><h2>Pozole</h2><p>Pozole is a traditional soup made with hominy and pork. Like most Mexican dishes, pozole has its origins in pre-Columbian times. The word “pozole” comes from the Nahuatl word “posolo,” which means “dry corn kernel.” Corn was a staple food for the Aztecs and other Mesoamerican cultures before European contact, as it was relatively easy to grow in many different climates and latitudes.</p><p>While pozole may be popular all over Mexico today, there is no state more associated with the dish than Jalisco—the birthplace of tequila! In fact, Jalisco has two official types of pozole: green (with chile) and white (without chile). Both are commonly served during celebrations such as weddings or baptisms—or even just because someone feels like having some friends over for lunch!</p><h2>Chilaquiles</h2><p>Chilaquiles are a traditional Mexican food dish made with fried tortillas, salsa or mole sauce, and eggs. The name chilaquiles comes from the Nahuatl word for the sauce: chili-aquilitl which means “chili water.” It's usually served for breakfast, but it's also a popular late night snack—especially when you haven't had dinner yet (or if you just want something warm).</p><p>The signature feature of this dish is its crunchy texture; that is achieved by frying the raw tortilla strips in oil until they become hard like chips. Once these have cooled down enough to eat comfortably, they're drenched with sauce and topped with your choice of meat toppings such as shredded chicken or beef stew meat. Then all you have to do is add some cheese on top!</p><h2>Elote (Mexican Street Corn)</h2><p>Elote is the Mexican street corn that's so good, you don't even need a grill to enjoy it. In fact, the only thing it requires is a hot oven and some patience.</p><p>You can eat elote right off the cob or mix it into guacamole or salsa! The traditional way to make this tasty treat is by grilling ears of corn until they're charred and smoky, then adding mayonnaise (or crema), chili powder, salt and lime juice or zest. But if you're not feeling like grilling outside in 90-degree heat (or if your grill isn't working properly), we've got an oven version for you!</p><p>To make Elote: Mix together 4 tablespoons mayonnaise with 1 teaspoon chili powder in a small bowl. Brush mixture onto all sides of each ear of corn; sprinkle with salt and bake on foil-lined baking sheet at 400°F for 10-15 minutes depending on size of cobs.</p><h2>Fajitas</h2><p>Fajitas are a popular food that originated in Texas and they are usually served as an appetizer or main course, but they can also be used as a side dish. Fajitas consist of grilled meat (usually beef) and vegetables, which are served on a tortilla with guacamole, salsa and cheese. They are prepared quite simply by grilling the meat and vegetables you want to include in your fajitas. You can then fry the tortillas until they become crispy before filling them with all your favorite ingredients!</p><h2>Jalapeño Poppers (Stuffed Jalapeños)</h2><p>Jalapeño poppers are small, bite-sized appetizers that are typically made by stuffing a whole jalapeño pepper with cheese, breading it, and then deep frying it. They can be served with a variety of dipping sauces, but are usually enjoyed on their own as a savory and spicy treat.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>There are many more popular foods that you can try in Mexico, but these are some of the most iconic. We hope you have fun trying them out and making your own memories while doing so!</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 14, 2022</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Ffood-in-mexico-the-best-and-most-popular-mexican-food%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.emeliastravels.com/assets/svg/facebook-svgrepo-com.svg"> <span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Ffood-in-mexico-the-best-and-most-popular-mexican-food%2F&amp;via=Emelia's%20Travels&amp;text=Food%20in%20Mexico%3A%20the%20Best%20and%20Most%20Popular%20Mexican%20Food" class="js-share icon brands fa-twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.emeliastravels.com/assets/svg/twitter-svgrepo-com.svg"> <span class="label">Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Ffood-in-mexico-the-best-and-most-popular-mexican-food%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F9%2Fdaniel-lloyd-blunk-fernandez-4BX3VmAXvFE-unsplash.jpg&amp;description=Food%20in%20Mexico%3A%20the%20Best%20and%20Most%20Popular%20Mexican%20Food" class="js-share icon brands fa-pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.emeliastravels.com/assets/svg/pinterest-svgrepo-com.svg"> <span class="label">Pinterest</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Ffood-in-mexico-the-best-and-most-popular-mexican-food%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.emeliastravels.com/assets/svg/linkedin-svgrepo-com.svg"> <span class="label">LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=Food%20in%20Mexico%3A%20the%20Best%20and%20Most%20Popular%20Mexican%20Food&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Ffood-in-mexico-the-best-and-most-popular-mexican-food%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.emeliastravels.com/assets/svg/buffer-svgrepo-com.svg"> <span class="label">Buffer</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Food%20in%20Mexico%3A%20the%20Best%20and%20Most%20Popular%20Mexican%20Food https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Ffood-in-mexico-the-best-and-most-popular-mexican-food%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.emeliastravels.com/assets/svg/whatsapp-svgrepo-com.svg"> <span class="label">WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://www.emeliastravels.com/authors/emelia/" class="invert" rel="author">Emelia</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><div id="search" class="alt"></div><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://www.emeliastravels.com/" target="_self">Home</a></li></ul></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Editor Pick's</h2></header><div class="mini-posts"><article><a href="https://www.emeliastravels.com/jet-lag-and-how-to-handle-it/" class="image fit"><img src="https://www.emeliastravels.com/media/posts/7/tim-de-pauw-SBYsc1gsA-M-unsplash.jpg" srcset="https://www.emeliastravels.com/media/posts/7/responsive/tim-de-pauw-SBYsc1gsA-M-unsplash-xs.jpg 300w, https://www.emeliastravels.com/media/posts/7/responsive/tim-de-pauw-SBYsc1gsA-M-unsplash-sm.jpg 480w, https://www.emeliastravels.com/media/posts/7/responsive/tim-de-pauw-SBYsc1gsA-M-unsplash-md.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 33vw" height="3648" width="5472" alt=""></a><h3><a href="https://www.emeliastravels.com/jet-lag-and-how-to-handle-it/">Jet Lag &amp; How to handle it</a></h3><p>Have you ever felt like you're in a different time zone than the one you're actually in?
