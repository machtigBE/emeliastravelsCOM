Check out our ultimate summer vacation packing list below so you know what to pack when you're traveling! By the way: we'll be only focusing on the summer travel essentials like clothing and other items, we'll assume your travel insurance and plane tickets are covered!</p><h2>Sunscreen</h2><p>Never forget to put sun protection on the packing checklist. Sunscreen becomes a necessity during summer travel because it is very important to protect your skin from the sun's rays, which can cause sunburn and even skin cancer.</p><p>It’s recommended that you bring at least 2 ounces of sunscreen in your luggage for each adult and child who will be traveling with you. If you are traveling with infants (under 6 months), they should also be protected by applying a thin layer of lotion or cream that has an SPF rating of 30+ every two hours while outdoors.</p><p>When choosing a sunscreen, keep in mind that certain types work better for different parts of the body:</p><ul><li>Face: Look for sunscreens labeled “broad spectrum” that contain both UVA (the aging rays) and UVB (the burning rays). Make sure they have an SPF rating between 15-50+ (the higher the rating, the better the protection).</li><li>Hands: Look for products with an SPF rating between 30+ and 50+, especially if you are going outside early in the morning or late at night when there is less UVB protection from clouds and other factors like pollution particles being released into the air by cars etc.. - Sunscreen helps prevent signs such as black spots on hands which often occur after working outdoors during summer days so make sure everyone keeps their hands protected (or covered) well no matter how short their trip might seem!</li></ul><h2>A hat</h2><p>A hat is an essential piece of summer travel attire you need pack when planning a summer trip. It provides protection against sunburn and heatstroke, it keeps bugs away from your face, and it helps to prevent sweat from stinging your eyes as you're hiking or biking.</p><p>Before you pack that cap from the '90s (that's not a thing anymore), consider what kind of hat will work best for your needs. Do you want something that shades most of your face but leaves room for sunglasses? Something easy to put in your backpack? Perhaps a brimmed hat or a sun hat would be more appropriate if you plan on spending most of your time outdoors in direct sunlight. Or maybe a baseball cap will keep things simple—and make sure everyone knows which team's colors are yours.</p><p>If this isn't enough information for you and all the different kinds of hats out there have left you confused, just remember that they're all meant to protect us from harmful rays while looking stylish as well!</p><h2>Sunglasses</h2><p>This is the one item you should never forget to pack on your summer vacation. But this is an essential not only when planning a summer holiday, even in winter (when the sun is at its lowest) glasses can be very helpful against the sun. Sunglasses are a must-have for people who like to spend time outside or in the water, as they protect your eyes from sun damage and glare. They also make you look cool while walking around town and exploring new locations!</p><ul><li>Pack an extra pair of sunglasses in your suitcase, just in case yours get lost or broken. Remember that you're going somewhere sunny, so make sure to bring along enough pairs for every day of your trip!</li><li>During long plane rides, it can be tough to keep track of all of your belongings (especially if you're trying not to freak out about flying), so consider packing a case specifically designed just for sunglasses. This will ensure that nothing gets lost during transit—and it'll prevent someone else from stealing them while they're sitting on top of someone's headrest at 30 miles per hour while hurtling through thin air above our planet's surface (for those who may not have experienced this firsthand).</li></ul><h2>Swimsuits</h2><p>When it comes to packing for your summer vacation, don’t forget the swimsuits. Your trip will be all about relaxing and having fun, so you want to make sure that you have plenty of ways to cool off during hot days at the beach or poolside. Swimsuits are also a great way to get some exercise and sun while enjoying a day at the beach or poolside.</p><p>You can choose from a variety of different styles when choosing swimsuits for your summer vacation:</p><ul><li>One piece swimsuits are great if you want something simple and easy-to-wear on your trip. These suits often come with skirts attached, which can help protect against sunburns while swimming in the ocean or working out at the gym.</li><li>Two piece bathing suits offer more coverage than one pieces do, making them perfect for any type of activity! Whether you're relaxing by yourself on a lounge chair reading under an umbrella or playing volleyball with friends on an outdoor court near an oceanfront hotel bar, these types of swimwear will work well no matter what kind of day it is because they offer full coverage without being too warm (as long as there's not too much direct sunlight).</li></ul><h2>A cover-up</h2><p>You might think it's silly to bring a cover-up with you on vacation, but hear me out! Cover-ups are a great way to keep cool when you're exploring your destination. They also double as swimsuits and beachwear, so they're perfect for traveling in hot climates. You can wear them as dresses or skirts when exploring town, or pair them with shorts for sightseeing. If you want something fun and flirty, there are tons of options that look like little kimonos or wraps---and they'll look great while keeping your skin shaded from the sun.</p><h2>Flip flops and sandals</h2><p>Flip flops and sandals are your best friends when it comes to footwear. They're both comfortable, easy to pack and you can use them at the beach, pool or hiking. Make sure you have a few pairs on hand!</p><h2>Sneakers</h2><p>Sneakers are the most versatile shoe you can bring on a vacation. They're great for sightseeing, exploring, hiking, walking and running. In fact, they're so versatile that they can replace almost any other pair of shoes in your closet while you travel—even if that means jogging through the streets of New York City or hiking up Mt. Kilimanjaro!</p><p>If you're looking to get active during your trip but still want to be comfortable doing it (and not ruining your sandals), sneakers are perfect for the job. Sneakers are lightweight and have lots of cushioning so they won't rub against your feet as much when walking long distances. Plus there's plenty of traction provided by rubber soles which makes them ideal for slippery surfaces like wet rocks or even snow-covered trails sometimes found at high altitudes like those found on mountain slopes throughout Europe or South America where many popular summer destinations reside year-round due to their mild weather conditions</p><h2>Comfortable walking shoes</h2><p>Comfortable walking shoes. Don't forget to pack a pair of comfortable walking shoes when going on vacation; you'll most likely be doing a lot of walking on your trip, so they should be able to handle all sorts of terrain and keep you stable as you move around town, also you don't want to end up with blisters by day two of your vacation!</p><p>When you plan on doing some serious hiking you can't forget your hiking boots!</p><p> </p><h2>A versatile dress or two</h2><p>You can wear dresses for a number of occasions. Whether you’re headed to the beach, a picnic, or the theater, these pieces are great options.</p><h2>Shorts, jeans and skirts</h2><p>Shorts, jeans and skirts are all good choices for packing. For warm weather, you'll want to pack shorts and skirts. Jeans are perfect for cooler weather and also make a great hiking companion (or an alternative to shorts if you're going somewhere with more formal attire). Denim can be dressed up or down depending on where you're headed, so pack your favorite pair of distressed ones if you need something fancier than the average pair of blue jeans!</p><h2>T-shirts and tanks, preferably in breathable fabrics!</h2><p>When packing for your summer getaway, it's important to consider what you'll be doing with your time. If you're going to be spending a lot of time on the beach or hanging out by the poolside, then it's essential that you have some stylish yet versatile beachwear options. You don't want to bring a bunch of clothes that will only work well in one setting—think about what else needs to go into your suitcase!</p><p>If all else fails and you need more motivation than this list alone provides, remember: no one wants to see what's under their swimsuit bottom when they're trying not to burn themselves on the sand!</p><h2>Light jackets, sweaters and a raincoat in case of cool weather</h2><p>Maybe you want to take a walk in the evening and watch the sunset over a different city skyline. Maybe you want to just kick back on your balcony or patio and listen to music while drinking coffee. Maybe you want to go out for dinner with friends, but it gets chilly at night where you're going. These are all good reasons why having a light jacket, sweater or raincoat with you is so important!</p><h2>Extra socks and underwear</h2><p>You may think you have everything you need, but don’t forget to pack extra socks and underwear. This is especially important if you plan on being a beach bum for the week. You never know when your bathing suit will accidentally go missing (or if it gets lost in the washing machine), so make sure that you have enough pairs of clean undies to last the week.</p><p>You should also make sure that your bathing suit cover-up is included on your packing list as well. If there's one thing I learned from my travel experience in Greece, it's that these things can be very useful when trying not to get sunburned while still enjoying yourself at the beach or poolside hotel bar!</p><h2>Bathing suit cover ups</h2><p>A bathing suit coverup is a light, loose-fitting garment that you can wear over your swimsuit to protect it from the sun and keep it clean. They're great for when you don't want to wear a tank top or t-shirt but need something to cover up with.</p><p>Bathing suit cover ups are also good if you want to go out at night and don't want the attention of strangers, who might be looking at your bare midriff or shoulders. You can buy them in different styles depending on what look you're going for: floral prints, striped patterns, solid colors, etc.</p><p>Tip: Make sure that whatever bathing suit coverup you have fits well (or isn't too big) so that it doesn't show off any parts of your body that might be considered inappropriate for public viewing!</p><h2>Chargers</h2><p>There's bound to be some electronics in your luggage (who doesn't have a laptop nowadays), so make sure you can charge them throughout your vacation! For some extra peace of mind check the location your are traveling to and be sure to pack a converter if you are traveling to another country that has different outlets than at home!</p><h2>Toiletry</h2><p>Most hotels have some essentials ready when you arrive, however it can never hurt to have some extra handy. Bring some shampoo, hygienics items and even a small water bottle (not only to stay hydrated but to have with you in every situation). If you have some room to put this in your carry-on luggage you'll have these essentials on you even if disaster strikes and you are separated from your other luggage! An extra tip would be to put all this in a waterproof bag so you don't have any unpleasant surprises when some bottle opens up mid-flight!</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>We hope this list has given you some ideas for what to bring on your next vacation. Remember that the most important thing is to be prepared, so if anything here doesn't apply to your trip, it's okay! Just make sure that you take enough time off work before leaving home so that there are no last minute emergencies (or major headaches). Also, don't forget to pack light - most airlines allow one checked bag per person weighing up to 50 pounds each way; plus they weigh all bags at check-in so plan accordingly. Happy travels!</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 14, 2022</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Fthe-ultimate-summer-vacation-packing-list%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Fthe-ultimate-summer-vacation-packing-list%2F&amp;via=Emelia's%20Travels&amp;text=The%20ultimate%20summer%20vacation%20packing%20list" class="js-share icon brands fa-twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Fthe-ultimate-summer-vacation-packing-list%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F8%2Flink-hoang-UoqAR2pOxMo-unsplash.jpg&amp;description=The%20ultimate%20summer%20vacation%20packing%20list" class="js-share icon brands fa-pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Pinterest</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Fthe-ultimate-summer-vacation-packing-list%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=The%20ultimate%20summer%20vacation%20packing%20list&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Fthe-ultimate-summer-vacation-packing-list%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Buffer</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=The%20ultimate%20summer%20vacation%20packing%20list https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Fthe-ultimate-summer-vacation-packing-list%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://www.emeliastravels.com/authors/emelia/" class="invert" rel="author">Emelia</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><div id="search" class="alt"></div><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://www.emeliastravels.com/" target="_self">Home</a></li></ul></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Editor Pick's</h2></header><div class="mini-posts"><article><a href="https://www.emeliastravels.com/jet-lag-and-how-to-handle-it/" class="image fit"><img src="https://www.emeliastravels.com/media/posts/7/tim-de-pauw-SBYsc1gsA-M-unsplash.jpg" srcset="https://www.emeliastravels.com/media/posts/7/responsive/tim-de-pauw-SBYsc1gsA-M-unsplash-xs.jpg 300w, https://www.emeliastravels.com/media/posts/7/responsive/tim-de-pauw-SBYsc1gsA-M-unsplash-sm.jpg 480w, https://www.emeliastravels.com/media/posts/7/responsive/tim-de-pauw-SBYsc1gsA-M-unsplash-md.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 33vw" loading="lazy" height="3648" width="5472" alt=""></a><h3><a href="https://www.emeliastravels.com/jet-lag-and-how-to-handle-it/">Jet Lag &amp; How to handle it</a></h3><p>Have you ever felt like you're in a different time zone than the one you're actually in?
