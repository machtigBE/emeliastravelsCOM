If you have, then you know what jet lag is. Jet lag is a condition that's caused by flying across multiple time zones. It can cause fatigue, insomnia, and a whole host of other symptoms. But there are ways to combat jet lag. In this blog, we'll explore some of the causes of jet lag and what you can do to minimize its effects.</p><h2>What Is Jet Lag?</h2><p>Jet lag is a temporary sleep disorder that can occur when you travel across multiple time zones. Your body has a natural circadian rhythm, or sleep cycle, that is based on the local time. When you travel across time zones, your body's circadian rhythm is disrupted and you may experience jet lag. Symptoms of jet lag include fatigue, insomnia, irritability, and poor concentration. Jet lag occurs because your body's circadian rhythm is out of sync with the local time. Traveling across time zones can also cause disruptions in your quality of sleep.</p><p> </p><h2>How is Jet Lag Different From Travel Fatigue?</h2><p>Travel fatigue is a feeling of tiredness or exhaustion that can be caused by a number of factors, including jet lag. Jet lag is a condition that is caused by a disruption to the body's circadian rhythm, and symptoms like fatigue, insomnia and irritability are common. Travel fatigue, on the other hand, is simply exhaustion from the act of travelling. It can be caused by a number of factors, including dehydration, hunger, and sitting in cramped spaces for long periods of time.</p><p>So, how can you tell the difference between jet lag and travel fatigue?</p><p>The easiest way to tell is to look at the symptoms. Jet lag symptoms tend to be worse when you’re trying to sleep. You may find it difficult to fall asleep and you may wake up feeling groggy and disoriented.</p><p>Travel fatigue, on the other hand, is more likely to hit you during the daytime. You may feel tired and sluggish, but you should be able to sleep at night.</p><p>Another way to tell the difference is to think about when the symptoms started. Jet lag symptoms will usually start to appear a day or two after you’ve travelled to a new time zone. Travel fatigue, on the other hand, can start to kick in during the journey itself.</p><p>So, if you’re feeling tired and out of sorts, but you’re not sure whether it’s jet lag or travel fatigue, take a look at the symptoms and think about when they started. If you’re still not sure, it’s best to see a doctor.</p><p> </p><h2>What Causes Jet Lag?</h2><p>Jet lag is a condition that can be caused by traveling through multiple time zones. It is a disruption of the body's natural circadian rhythm, which is the 24-hour cycle that regulates the body's sleep-wake cycle. Jet lag happens when the body's circadian rhythm is out of sync with the new time zone.</p><p> </p><h2>How Can You Prevent or Reduce Jet Lag?</h2><p>Fortunately, there are some things you can do to prevent or reduce jet lag. Here are a few tips:</p><p> </p><p>-Get plenty of rest before your trip. This will help ensure that your body is well-rested before it has to deal with the stresses of travel.</p><p>-Adjust your sleep schedule gradually in the days leading up to your trip. If you're traveling east, start going to bed and waking up earlier each day. If you're traveling west, do the opposite. This will help your body start to adjust to the new time zone.</p><p>-Expose yourself to natural light at your destination. This will help reset your body's internal clock.</p><p>-Limit your exposure to artificial light, such as from computers, phones, and TVs. This can make it harder for your body to fall asleep.</p><p>-Take melatonin supplements. Melatonin is a hormone that helps regulate sleep. Taking it can help you fall asleep more easily and get a better night's sleep.</p><p>-Use medical sleep medicine if you need something more to help you sleep. If you're having trouble sleeping, talk to your doctor about whether sleep aids are right for you.</p><p>-Avoid caffeine and alcohol. Caffeine can make it harder to fall asleep, while alcohol can disrupt your sleep which can also contribute to jet lag.</p><p>-Arrive at your destination early. This will give you time to adjust to the new time zone and minimize the effects of jet lag.</p><p> </p><p>Once you arrive at your destination, it’s important to try to stay on local time. This means getting up and going to bed at the same time as the locals. It can be tempting to stay up late and sleep in, but this will only make jet lag worse!</p><p> </p><h2>What are symptoms of jet lag?</h2><p>Jet lag is a condition that can occur when you travel across time zones but especially when you travel eastward. The main symptom of jet lag is fatigue, which can make it difficult to fall asleep at night and make you feel drowsy during the day. Other symptoms of jet lag include insomnia, irritability, headaches, and gastrointestinal problems but this can vary from person to person. In severe cases, jet lag can lead to anxiety and even depression!</p><p> </p><h2>Does taking melatonin work for jet lag?</h2><p>Fortunately, there are a few things you can do to combat jet lag. One popular remedy is taking melatonin. But does melatonin really work for jet lag?</p><p> </p><p>Melatonin is a hormone that helps regulate sleep and to set your body clock. Your body naturally produces melatonin through light exposure, and levels of the hormone increase at night, making you feel sleepy.</p><p> </p><p>Travel can disrupt your body's production of melatonin, which can contribute to jet lag. Taking a melatonin supplement can help restore normal levels of the hormone and help you fall asleep. There is some scientific evidence to support the use of melatonin for jet lag. One study found that taking melatonin helped people fall asleep more quickly and improved sleep quality.</p><p> </p><p>However, melatonin isn't right for everyone. It can cause side effects like headaches and nausea. And it can interact with certain medications. If you're considering taking melatonin for jet lag, talk to your doctor first.</p><p> </p><h2>Can Jet Lag Have Long-Term Consequences?</h2><p>There’s no doubt that jet lag can be tough to deal with. And while most people recover from jet lag within a week or so, there are some who continue to feel the effects for months, or even years. So what’s going on? Why does jet lag seem to have such a long-lasting impact on some people?</p><p> </p><p>Our bodies are complex systems, and when we travel across time zones, our bodies can have a hard time adjusting to the new schedule. This can lead to long-term disruptions in our sleep patterns, which in turn can have a ripple effect on our overall health.</p><p> </p><p>Another theory is that jet lag can impact our gut health. Our gut microbes play a key role in regulating our circadian rhythms, and when they’re out of sync, it can lead to digestive issues, fatigue, and other problems.</p><p> </p><h2>Can you get delayed jet lag?</h2><p>What is delayed jet lag you ask? Delayed jet lag is, quite simply, a delayed reaction to crossing time zones. It can happen when you travel eastward, as your body has a harder time adjusting to the shorter days, or when you travel westward and your body has a harder time adjusting to the longer days.</p><p> </p><p>The good news is that delayed jet lag is usually not as bad as regular jet lag. The bad news is that it can still last for several days or even up to a week. The symptoms of delayed jet lag are similar to those of regular jet lag, including fatigue, insomnia, irritability, and difficulty concentrating.</p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately there's no surefire way to prevent delayed jet lag, keep the regular tips in mind to get plenty of rest before the trip, drink lots of water, eat light meals and most importantly adjust your sleep schedule gradually before your trip!</p><p> </p><h2>How common is jet lag?</h2><p>It's estimated that every year, jet lag affects millions of people who travel by air. And if you fly often enough just about everyone has experienced jet lag at some point.</p><p> </p><h2>What’s going on in my body when I have jet lag?</h2><p>Your body has an internal clock, set by cues from the environment, that tells you when to sleep, eat, and be active. This clock is called the circadian rhythm.</p><p> </p><p>Light is the main cue that sets your circadian rhythm. When it’s light outside, your body produces a hormone called cortisol that makes you feel alert. At night, when it’s dark, your body produces a hormone called melatonin that makes you feel sleepy.</p><p> </p><p>Jet lag happens when your body’s circadian rhythm is out of sync with the time in your new location. For example, if you fly from New York to Los Angeles, your body is used to being on East Coast time. But now you’re in a different time zone, and your body is trying to adjust to the new schedule.</p><p> </p><p>This can be hard on your body, and it can take a few days to adjust. In the meantime, you may feel tired, have trouble sleeping, or be more irritable than usual.</p><p> </p><h2>Does jet lag make you dizzy?</h2><p>Jet lag is a real phenomenon that can affect your body in some pretty strange ways. And yes, you may even feel dizzy or lightheaded! You may also have trouble balance and coordination.</p><p> </p><h2>When is jet lag the worst?</h2><p>For most people, jet lag is worst when they're flying east. This is because your body is used to the rising sun and when you travel east, you're effectively going against your body's natural clock. This can be a real challenge if you're flying to a place like Japan or China where the time difference is significant.</p><p>If you're flying east to west, it's generally not as bad. This is because you're effectively gaining time as you travel and your body will eventually catch up. However, this doesn't mean that jet lag can't still be a problem.</p><p> </p><h2>How long does it take to recover from jet lag?</h2><p>It generally takes a few days for your body to adjust to the new time zone. So, be patient and give yourself some time to recover. By following the tips above you can reduce and minimize the fatigue and other symptoms caused by jet lag.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 8, 2022</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Fjet-lag-and-how-to-handle-it%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Fjet-lag-and-how-to-handle-it%2F&amp;via=Emelia's%20Travels&amp;text=Jet%20Lag%20%26%20How%20to%20handle%20it" class="js-share icon brands fa-twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Fjet-lag-and-how-to-handle-it%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F7%2Ftim-de-pauw-SBYsc1gsA-M-unsplash.jpg&amp;description=Jet%20Lag%20%26%20How%20to%20handle%20it" class="js-share icon brands fa-pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Pinterest</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Fjet-lag-and-how-to-handle-it%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=Jet%20Lag%20%26%20How%20to%20handle%20it&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Fjet-lag-and-how-to-handle-it%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Buffer</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Jet%20Lag%20%26%20How%20to%20handle%20it https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeliastravels.com%2Fjet-lag-and-how-to-handle-it%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><strong>Tagged in:</strong></li><li><a href="https://www.emeliastravels.com/tags/sidebar/">sidebar</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://www.emeliastravels.com/authors/emelia/" class="invert" rel="author">Emelia</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><div id="search" class="alt"></div><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://www.emeliastravels.com/" target="_self">Home</a></li></ul></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Editor Pick's</h2></header><div class="mini-posts"><article><a href="https://www.emeliastravels.com/jet-lag-and-how-to-handle-it/" class="image fit"><img src="https://www.emeliastravels.com/media/posts/7/tim-de-pauw-SBYsc1gsA-M-unsplash.jpg" srcset="https://www.emeliastravels.com/media/posts/7/responsive/tim-de-pauw-SBYsc1gsA-M-unsplash-xs.jpg 300w, https://www.emeliastravels.com/media/posts/7/responsive/tim-de-pauw-SBYsc1gsA-M-unsplash-sm.jpg 480w, https://www.emeliastravels.com/media/posts/7/responsive/tim-de-pauw-SBYsc1gsA-M-unsplash-md.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 33vw" height="3648" width="5472" alt=""></a><h3><a href="https://www.emeliastravels.com/jet-lag-and-how-to-handle-it/">Jet Lag &amp; How to handle it</a></h3><p>Have you ever felt like you're in a different time zone than the one you're actually in?
